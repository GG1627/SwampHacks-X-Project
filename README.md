- Users are prompted to choose a sorting algorithm as well as what search criteria to sort the games by.

# How The Results Are Collected
- The C++ code initially takes in the game's name, finds that game, then filters out all game's in the dataset that don't have that game's same genre.
- Based on the game console, the dataset is then further filters out all game's that aren't on that console.
- Utilizing the sorting method and the search criteria, the dataset is then sorted.

- Users are shown the time taken by the sorting algorithm and are given a list of games that meet their search criteria and what those values are.
