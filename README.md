# About 
This project was created within 24 hours during the SwampHacks X hackathon, under the Social Good & Human Experience category. It was created with a focus on student mental health and community resources. In the tech field, taking breaks and connecting with others is essential, not only for one's wellbeing, but also to aid productivity in the long-term. Therapists often recommend journaling and reaching out to others as effective strategies for improving mental health. Journaling helps individuals process their emotions, gain self-awareness, and manage stress, while connecting with others fosters support, reduces feelings of isolation, and strengthens relationships, all of which contribute positively to mental well-being. These elements formed the foundation of our project, emphasizing the value of prioritizing mental well-being in both personal and professional spaces.

- Users are able to add reminders to the calendar to reach out to ones they're close with.
- Acts of reaching out and fostering connections strengthen social bonds, reduce feelings of isolation, and promote emotional support. Additionally, helping or showing care for others can boost your own sense of purpose and happiness, thanks to the psychological benefits of altruism and community engagement.
